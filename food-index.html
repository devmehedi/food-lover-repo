            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>What can I say I love food. My journey as a chef brought me from Michigan to Oklahoma and now to
                Cailfornia. and who knows where else.The thing I love most about food is the interaction between people.
                Whether that is cooking with friends or family, teaching someone to cook, or that feeling when they try
                your food.I am now a private chef for NBA player Kevin Durant.Working for an athlete for 5 years I am
                able to take those classic comfort food dishes and put a healthy spin on them.I encourage you to cook in
                the kitchen and hope I can inspired you to be creative with food. Enjoy what you do, do it with passion
                and always season with love.</p>

                <h2>Bengali Chicken Curry with Potatoes</h2>
                <p>A delicious authentic recipe of chicken curry. I've had this almost every day growing up. If you want
                    a more creamy and
                    smooth sauce, blend the onions and tomatoes before adding the chicken and potatoes.
